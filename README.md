# Titanic
I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier analysis, missing value analysis, 
and encoding operations (Label Encoder, Rare Encoder, One-Hot Encoder) on the Titanic dataset. 
I also derived additional variables using feature engineering techniques to increase the number of variables related to survival. 
I used the variable "SURVIVED" as the dependent variable and conducted a modeling process.
